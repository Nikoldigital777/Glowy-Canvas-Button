# Glowy-Canvas-Button: Interactive Button with Dynamic Color Scheme
This project showcases an interactive button that uses micro-interactions and a dynamic color scheme based on the time of day. The micro-interactions include a ripple effect and color change when the button is hovered over or clicked. The color scheme adjusts based on the time of day to reduce eye strain for users using the application at different times.
